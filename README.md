# Laugh-Out-Loud As A Service

Inspired by http://foaas.com and http://twitter.com/computionist, this started as a 
project to generate lol-ified words.

For example, from the word 'Python' we generate the word 'Pythloln'. From the
word 'MongoDB' we generate the word 'MonglolDB'.

It's derisive, but somehow amusing.

I added '/jerk' because I didn't feel like support XML output. And calling people
jerks when they ask for XML seemed like the right thing to do.
